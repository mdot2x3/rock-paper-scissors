Plan:
Interface? Console
Inputs? Prompt query to user
Output?
	1. The computer's generated value vs the user's input value
	2. The result of the current round, the result total for all rounds in the game session

Pseudocode:

Function getComputerChoice returns random sting value from (“rock”, “paper” or “scissors”)

Function getHumanChoice returns valid string value from user prompt (“rock”, “paper” or “scissors”)

Variables humanScore and computerScore are initialed to 0

Function playRound takes parameters (humanChoice and computerChoice)

getHumanChoice and getComputerChoice are assigned to variables humanSelection and computerSelection
	humanSelection set to case insensitive

Run playRound with humanSelection and computerSelection as arguments

Output round results as string to console

Increment humanScore and computerScore based on round winner

Function playGame calls playRound five times

playGame outputs the result of the game after five rounds complete
